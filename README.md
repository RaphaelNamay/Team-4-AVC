# Team-4-AVC

### Teams React

## Checklist 

### Week 1: 

- [x] Create Github repo (Dan)
- [x] Design and model the chassis and parts required (Jeffrey)
- [x] Assemble prototype for testing (Vincent/Jio)
- [x] Implement camera sensor code (Dan)
- [x] Devise an algorithm for robotâ€™s movement  (Tariq)

1.All of our team members performed well against their goal tasks. We set up goals for each team member this week. Changes were made to our individual member tasks, therefore, everyone's roles are more flexible. Jio and Vincent are working on assembling the model. Dan and Tariq are working on the software part and Jeffrey is updating the github. The task list for week 2 and 3 has been updated. All the updated code is on github. Everyone attended all the lab sessions, even working together overtime. We need to attach the sensors to the chassis and Jeffrey will update the github.

### Week 2:

- [x] Test code from week 1 (Tariq)
- [x] 3D print parts (Jeffrey)
- [x] Assemble the final chassis design robot (Vincent/Jio)
- [x] Get robot to turn accordingly ( Dan)

Everyone completed their tasks this week. The robot hardware has been printed and assembled. The code needs some more tweaking to make the robot follow the line smoothly. This will improve when PID is added. Everyone showed up to lab sessions. The task list has been completed for all weeks. Sensors still need to be attached, (Jio and Vincent). Tariq will help Dan with qaudrant 3.

### Week 3:

- [x] Test progress on software (Tariq)
- [x] Open gates (Jeffrey)
- [x] Implement PID control (Jio)
- [x] Deal with T-junctions (Dan)
- [x] Update goals, checklist (Vincent)

Tariq and Dan have been working on Quadrant 3, which is mostly complete with some tweaking required. The pseudocode for the maze has been completed by Jio and Vincent, Jeffrey has 3D printed a new chassis with improved screw holes to mount the plates, and also helped with testing. The gateOpen code has been implemented. Overall, everyone has achieved their tasks for the week, while also completing some extra tasks as required. Everyone showed up to the meeting and lab. 

### Week 4:

- [ ] Test progress on software (Tariq)
- [ ] Optimise code (Jio)
- [ ] Implement code for maze nav (Dan)
- [ ] Update checklist, goals, help with software/Hardware (Vincent)
- [ ] Refine chassis if necessary, help with maze nav (Jeffrey)
